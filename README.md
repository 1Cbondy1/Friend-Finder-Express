# Friend-Finder-Express

Frinder is a full-stack web application that takes in results from a user survey and compares the answers with those from other users stored in the api. Specifically, it uses a linear regressive algorithm to find the most compatible friend from the arrays of user submitted survey answers. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. It uses express for routing and is hosted using Heroku.

Here is a link to the app deployed on Heroku: https://gentle-escarpment-80143.herokuapp.com/
